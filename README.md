# Black Friday Sales - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

## 📄 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing the **Black Friday Sales Dataset** to uncover meaningful insights about customer purchasing behavior. By performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, the project aims to identify trends, patterns, and factors influencing sales during Black Friday.  

## 📊 Dataset Description  
The dataset contains anonymized information about customers and their purchase behavior, including:  
- **User Information**: Age, Gender, Marital Status, etc.  
- **Product Information**: Product ID, Product Category, etc.  
- **Purchase Information**: Purchase amount for each transaction.  

### Key Features of the Dataset:  
- **Rows**: (Number of rows in the dataset, e.g., `550,000`)  
- **Columns**: (Number of columns, e.g., `12`)  
-The dataset used for this project is available in this repository. You can access it directly:
 [Black Friday Sales Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/sdolezel/black-friday](https://github.com/Braj-01/BlackFridaySales/blob/main/BlackFriday/BlackFriday.csv)).  

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries  
- **Python**: For scripting and analysis  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for analysis  

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

The project includes:  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Removing duplicate records  
   - Correcting inconsistent data formats  

2. **Descriptive Analysis**  
   - Summary statistics  
   - Distribution of features like Age, Gender, Product Categories, etc.  

3. **Visualizations**  
   - Sales trends across various demographics (e.g., Age, Gender, Marital Status).  
   - Popular product categories during Black Friday.  
   - Purchase patterns based on city tiers.  
   - Correlation analysis to identify factors influencing purchase amounts.  

4. **Key Insights**  
   - Identifying high-value customers.  
   - Which product categories drive the most revenue?  
   - How does location (city tier) affect sales?  

## 🎯 Key Findings
